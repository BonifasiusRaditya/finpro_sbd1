# MBGku - Makan Bergizi Gratis Application Context

## Project Overview
MBGku is a digital platform designed to digitalize Indonesia's "Makan Bergizi Gratis" (Free Nutritious Meals) program initiated by President Prabowo. The application manages the distribution and tracking of free nutritious meals for students across Indonesian schools.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend/Backend**: Next.js (React framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database Client**: pg (node-postgres)

## Application Architecture
The system consists of three main user types:

### 1. STUDENT SIDE
- **Login**: Students log into their personal accounts
- **QR Code Generation**: Each student receives a unique daily QR code
- **Meal Claiming**: Students present QR code to school for scanning
- **One-per-day Limit**: Each student can only claim one meal per day
- **Account Creation**: Student accounts are created only by their respective schools

### 2. SCHOOL SIDE
- **QR Code Scanning**: Schools scan student QR codes to mark meal claims
- **Dashboard**: 
  - Statistics of meals distributed today
  - Current menu display
  - Daily meal allocation tracking
- **Meal Tracking**: Record and track all meal distributions
- **Account Management**: Schools can change their passwords after government creates their account
- **Account Creation**: School accounts are created only by local government

### 3. GOVERNMENT SIDE
- **Provincial Overview**: Monitor all schools within their "Provinsi" (province)
- **Distribution Tracking**: Monitor food distribution from shipment to actual consumption
- **Financial Oversight**: Calculate total spending based on portion prices
- **Menu Management**: 
  - Choose menus for each school
  - Set portion quantities per school
  - AI-powered menu selection capabilities
- **School Management**: Create and manage school accounts
- **Analytics**: High-level view of program effectiveness

## Database Schema

### Core Tables:
1. **governments**: Provincial government accounts and contact information
2. **schools**: School information linked to their governing province
3. **users**: Student information linked to their school
4. **menus**: Available meal menus with pricing
5. **school_menu_allocations**: Daily menu assignments and quantities per school
6. **reception_logs**: Records of actual meal claims by students

### Key Relationships:
- Governments → Schools (1:many)
- Schools → Students/Users (1:many)
- Schools → Menu Allocations (many:many through school_menu_allocations)
- Students → Reception Logs (1:many, but max 1 per day)

## Business Rules
1. **One meal per student per day**: Enforced via UNIQUE constraint on (user_id, date)
2. **Hierarchical account creation**: 
   - Government creates school accounts
   - Schools create student accounts
3. **Provincial management**: Each government manages schools within their province
4. **Daily menu allocation**: Schools receive specific menus and quantities each day
5. **Tracking chain**: Food distribution tracked from government allocation → school receipt → student consumption

## Key Features to Implement
- [ ] QR code generation and scanning system
- [ ] Real-time dashboard for schools
- [ ] Provincial analytics for governments  
- [ ] AI-powered menu selection
- [ ] Daily allocation management
- [ ] Financial reporting and cost calculation
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for student access
- [ ] Authentication system for all three user types

## Current Development Status
- Database configuration with Neon PostgreSQL
- Basic repository structure for governments
- API endpoints for government authentication
- Working on resolving database connection timeout issues

## Environment Setup
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL
- Environment variables: DATABASE_URL required
- SSL configuration: rejectUnauthorized: false for Neon connection

This application serves a critical social program in Indonesia, providing digital infrastructure to ensure transparent and efficient distribution of free nutritious meals to students nationwide.
